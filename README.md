# Immersive_Technology_Game
## Goal and Controls
### Goal
You are a maintenance worker, working in the sewers to close valves that are leaking polluting substances. You must close all 5 valves to win.
### Controls
- Move with the left thumbstick
- Rotate your head with the right thumbstick, or by physically moving your head
- Grab onto valves or your axe with the trigger buttons on either your left or right controller
- If grabbing onto a valve, rotate clockwise to close it
- Swing your axe at wooden planks to destroy them
## Caveats
- A potential issue with the build of the game. As I am using an MSI laptop to work on this project, the build of the game appears as an MSI App Player .apk file. It is an APK, so it should work? But if it doesn't, I hope you appreciate that I did the best I could when I created the build, and you can always create a build in Unity if for some reason it doesn't work
